> **Advanced Threat Hunting & Detection Engineering using Kusto Query Language (KQL)**

---

## 📖 Overview

This repository contains a curated collection of **Kusto Query Language (KQL)** queries developed for use with **Microsoft Defender XDR Advanced Hunting**, **Microsoft Sentinel**, and related security monitoring platforms.

The queries are designed to support:

* 🔍 Proactive Threat Hunting
* 🚨 Incident Investigation
* 🧠 Detection Engineering
* 🛠️ Security Operations (SOC) Activities
* 📊 Security Analytics & Visibility

The primary objective of this repository is to help identify and investigate advanced threats, including previously unknown attack patterns and zero-day activity that may bypass traditional signature-based security controls.

---

## 🎯 Detection Focus Areas

This repository includes detections and hunting queries related to:

* 💥 Zero-Day Attack Detection
* 🦠 Malware & Ransomware Activity
* 🕵️ Living-off-the-Land (LotL) Techniques
* 🔐 Persistence & Privilege Escalation
* ⚡ Suspicious PowerShell & Script Execution
* 🛡️ Microsoft Defender Tampering Attempts
* 👤 Abnormal Identity & Endpoint Activity
* 🚫 Security Evasion Techniques
* 📉 Security Hygiene & Misconfiguration Detection
